<b>Caesar Cipher Python Program</b><br>
This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift value.


<b>How the Caesar Cipher Works (Example):</b><br>
For example, if the message is "HELLO", and the shift is 3:
'H' becomes 'K' (shifted by 3)
'E' becomes 'H'
'L' becomes 'O'
'L' becomes 'O'
'O' becomes 'R'<br>
Thus, the encrypted message will be "KHOOR", and using the same shift value of 3, the message can be decrypted back to "HELLO".
